# CS127
My assignments for CS127. These will not be usable software in any way, but they should work!

### Building

#### Easy
To build any single project, just go into the directory and run the main file with python or compile all cpp files with g++ in C++11 mode. 

#### "Complicated"
If you know how to build with cmake, do that. Otherwise, run the following:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

You can then go into any subfolder and run the appropriate python or exe files.
